How to use:

Do /playerpet spawn <name> [skin] to spawn in a custom PlayerPet! Then right-click it to ride it, and sneak & right-click to have it ride you! He will follow you around if you are not riding on him, he will also look at you! If you leave the game, your pet will be removed. 
Click a player head to open the selection inventory! 

Features:
=========
If you put '-' in the name, it turns into a space, and the Essentials color codes work with it too. 


To add prefixes, do /playerpet prefix <prefix>. It works the same as the names do. 
To add sufixes, do /playerpet suffix <suffix >. It works the same as the names do. 

PlayerPets will also follow where you look if you have a stick in your hand! 


Want to teleport them around? Whenever you teleport, they teleport with you! 
If you left-click a stick, they will be teleported to you! (Might take a couple tries!)
